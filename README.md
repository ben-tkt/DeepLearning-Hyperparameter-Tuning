# Creating and Tuning Deep Learning Models
In this project, I focus on tuning the hyperparameters of a neural network to predict a passenger's survival rate on the Titanic incident.

# Building Clustering Models to study unstructured data

## ðŸŽ¯ My Objectives
* To share my work
* Receive feedback on improving my methods
* Serve as reference material for anyone trying to learn how to create and tune neural networks for a regression problem.

## ðŸ““ Project Description 
* **Objective** - To build a deep learning model to predict a passenger's survival rate on the Titanic
* **Problem Statement** - Perform EDA on data, build and refine a deep learning model, and make predictions on unseen data.
* **Data Source** - Provided by Great Learning as materials for the project. [Can be found in repository]

## ðŸ““ Data Dictionary
* Player_Name: Name of the player.
* Club: Club in which the player plays.
* Position: Position in which the player plays.
* Goals_Scored: Number of goals scored by the player in the previous season.
* Assists: Number of passes made by the player leading to goals in the previous season.
* Total_Points: Total number of fantasy points scored by the player in the previous season.
* Minutes: Number of minutes played by the player in the previous season.
* Goals_Conceded: Number of goals conceded by the player in the previous season.
* Creativity: A score, computed using a range of stats, that assesses player performance in terms of producing goalscoring opportunities for other players.
* Influence: A score, computed using a range of stats, that evaluates a player's impact on a match, taking into account actions that could directly or indirectly affect the match outcome.
* Threat: A score, computed using a range of stats, that gauges players who are most likely to score goals.
* Bonus: Total bonus points received. The three best performing players in each match receive additional bonus points based on a score computed using a range of stats. 3 points are awarded to the highest scoring player, 2 to the second best, and 1 to the third.
* Clean_Sheets: Number of matches without conceding a goal in the previous season.

## ðŸ““Key Features Used
* Libraries used - Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikitlearn

## ðŸ““ Techniques used
* **Cleaning data** from irrelevant data, missing data, duplicated data and outliers
* **Data visualization** using seaborn plots
* **Exploratory Data Analysis** (Univariate and multivariate)
* **Data Preprocessing** by standardizing and scaling data before training algorithms
* **Dimensionality Reduction** using Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
* **Building Clustering Algorithms**
  * K-Means Clustering
  * K-Medoids Clustering
  * Heirarchical/Agglomerative Clustering
  * Gaussian Mixture Modelling
  * Density-based Clustering 
* **Clustering Technique Evaluation** using Silhouette Score

## ðŸ““ Usage Guide
**For Recruiters**
1. Open up the .ipynb or .HTML file to understand into details what was done in the project.
2. Kindly contact me if you want to know more ðŸ˜ƒ

**For Learners**
1. Download the dataset from the respository and the .ipynb file.
2. Open the .ipynb file using Google Colaboratory or jupyter notebook.
3. Read through the project context, objective, data description and dictionary.
4. Try and run the code in the .ipynb notebook, cell by cell. As the codes are well-commented, try to understand what each line of code does.
5. Use my code as a reference if you're stucked [In this particular project, I have had the privilege of learning from Seyed Mohammad Parvasi and his amazing coding practices.]
